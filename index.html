     width=200 height=135   /><br>Hello! My name is Zoya, and I am currently a first-year university student in Japan, majoring in Information Technology. As I embark on this exciting academic journey, I am thrilled about the opportunities to explore the ever-evolving world of technology and its myriad applications in our daily lives.
<br><br>
Choosing to study IT was an easy decision for me, as I have always been fascinated by the power of technology to solve problems and improve our quality of life. From developing software applications to understanding the complexities of network security, the field of IT offers endless possibilities, and I am eager to dive deep into my studies.
<br><br>
Aside from my academic interests, I am passionate about volleyball. Playing volleyball has been a significant part of my life, and it has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and strategic thinking. The sport not only keeps me physically active but also provides a great way to unwind and connect with friends.
<br>
As I navigate through my university years, I look forward to balancing my academic pursuits with my love for volleyball. I am excited to learn, grow, and make the most of my time here in Japan, both in the classroom and on the court.
